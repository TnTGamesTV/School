I won't comment on them, but it can be, sometimes in english, sometimes in german. If you're searching for some api's or useful java classes try my [Useful Java Classes](http://www.github.com/TnTGamesTV/Useful) repository, where you can find things like mysql or reflections.\r\n\r\n### Copyright & Crediting\r\nEverything I'm posting is under my copyright, if not, I'm crediting the person.\r\n\r\n### Pull requests\r\nFor my school repository:\r\nI won't accept pull requests, because it is school work.\r\n\r\nFor my 'useful java classes' repository:\r\nI will, just ask.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis project is created by @TnTGamesTV and supported by @210812chm.
